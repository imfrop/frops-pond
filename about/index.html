          <p>My name is Luiz Eduardo but everyone calls me 'frop', i'm 19 years old, i live in Brazil and i'm a dinosaur and tech enthusiast.
          I have a channel on Twitch where i mostly stream Rocket League, it's a place where i can share a bit of myself and
          have some fun.

            I'm currently taking Design at PUCGO, but i also took 2 semesters of Computer Science at the same University

            My main occupation aside from being a student is as an illustrator.

          <p>My hobbies consist of programming (i have basic knowledge of C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS with possibility to dive deeper), graphic design, video-games and manga.</p>
          <p>I'm fluent in English, Portuguese and i can understand the basics of Spanish, i have moderate knowledge of computers due to being exposed to them since i was 6.</p>
